  ## Description

  ## Usage
    Each turn, players are prompted with a list of possible actions.  Typing in the command line informs the program which to do, and will keep track of the player's progress by
    continuously calculating and updating portfolio balances.  Players can choose to inspect market prices for each stock, buy or sell a stock, or wait and let the market prices
    update.  Taking an action will cause markets to update, so players are constantly faced with the option to buy or sell at differing prices.  Stocks each have a volatility value
    associated with them, which is randomly generated, and influences how far up or down they may move.

import random

# ---------- Pseudocode ----------

# Randomly generate a set of stocks and their prices

# Set initial value of user's cash on hand

# Prompt user to buy, sell, hold, or inspect their holdings

# If the user selects buy, prompt them for the stock to buy and for how much

# Validate inputs for existing stock tickers and to limit upper thresholds not to exceed balance

# ELSE IF user selects sell, validate for existing holdings and show them, then prompt which to sell

# Validate for a nonzero quantity and add the balance of proceeds to their account

# Repeat loop
